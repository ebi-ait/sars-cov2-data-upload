                <p>To use the data uploader you need to request a secure submission key, by contacting our helpdesk -
                    virus-dataflow@ebi.ac.uk. In your request, please provide an email address, and, if already created,
                    a Webin submission account. Please let us know if you would like a new Webin account created. A user
                    support bioinformatician will contact you and provide you with a secure submission key within a
                    working day.</p>
                <p>Can I share my submission key? The secure submission key uniquely identifies you and serves as
                    authentication to the uploader file - do not share your submission key unless you want to share file
                    access.</p>
